# Famouse Chocolate Rum Balls #

* 3 1/4 cups vanilla wafers
* 3/4 cup confectioner's sugar
* 1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
* 1 1/2 cups chopped walnuts (optional)
* 3 tablespoons light corn syrup
* 2/3 cup rum

Crush vanilla wafers. Placing them in a zip bag, with air mostly removed and smashing with your fists is one way to crush the vanilla wafers. Be creative, they are your Rum Balls.

Find a large bowl. Mix together the newly crushed vanilla wafers, confectioner's sugar, cocoa, and your [optional] nuts. Take a shot to verify Rum has not expired. Blend in rum and corn syrup.

Shape into balls of desired size. Roll in additional confectioner's sugar otherwise they will never leave your hands. Place in airtight container with additional confectioner's sugar and chill in refrigerator. 

People say to leave them for several days. Don't do this. Serve them after they are suitably chilled. If there's a flush in the cheeks while eating the rum balls declare your batch a success. Eat Rum Balls responsibly.
