# Savory Chocolate Caramel Pretzels #

* 1 bag of mini pretzels (Snyder's brand)
* 1 bag unwrapped Rolo candies
* 1 bag pecan halves

Line a cookie sheet with baking parchment. Put a layer of mini pretzels
on the cookie sheet, leaving an inch or so between them. Put a Rolo
candy on each pretzel. Bake at 350Â° just long enough to soften the
candy, about 4 to 5 min. then take them out of the oven. Put a pecan
half on each Rolo and gently smush it. Cool until candy hardens again,
then serve.
